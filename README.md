## Project Overview

This project was created based on a tutorial I followed a few years ago.
The tutorial provided a comprehensive guide on creating a web page using HTML, Tailwind as a CSS framework, and JavaScript.
The goal was to replicate the styles and structure of a website. 
I implemented the project to enhance my understanding of Tailwind, CSS.

### Technologies Used

•  HTML: For structuring the content of the web page.

•  JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic features to the web page.

### Libraries and Frameworks

•  Tailwind: A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing 
   a set of pre-designed utility classes.

## Features
•  Responsive Design: Ensures the web page looks good on all devices.
